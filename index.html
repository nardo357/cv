        <h2>My First Hand Coded Website</h2>
        <p><em>I am a self learnt web developer. With hopes of becoming a full stack web developer.</em></p>
        <p>I always had a passion for technology and software since a very young age. I am a graduate of the University of the Southern Caribbean with a Bsc. Computer Science with an Emphasis
        on Software Engineering. Honestly, I knew that there wasn't a demand for my degree in Triniadad and Tobago, hence I decided to start my own Business; Music Forte TT Limited, as a way to provide for my family without concern.
        However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic my business was affected negatively, hence I decided to seek a more stable income.
        Since I already do website design as a "side hussle" as an additional source of income, I thought that I would see what was available in this field. I knew some HTML and CSS but I would lean heavily on using CMS and other platforms to assist
        with the overall design and funcution of a website. Upon researching I decided that I would further my study and become a full stack developer. Although job oppurtunities within my country in this field are somewhat limited, I have noticed
        that the internationl market seems plentiful of job oppurtunites.</p>
